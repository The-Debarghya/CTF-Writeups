# Pedometer-In-Real-World
A simple application that counts number of steps covered by a person.

* Accepts smartphone inbuilt **Accelerometer** data through a web interface and then calculates number of steps, time elapsed and approximate distance covered.
* *Currently not a standalone Mobile Application*

*P.S.-Currently under development of proper interface, but the data analysis part remains same!*
